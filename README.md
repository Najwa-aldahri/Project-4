## Goal 
Welcome to **üå∏Flower Shope Applicationüå∏** We‚Äôre here to help you spread smiles with our fresh and vibrant flowers.
- Whether it‚Äôs a birthday, anniversary, or just because, we‚Äôve got the perfect blooms to make every moment special,bright bouquets, and a little bit of floral magic let‚Äôs make someone‚Äôs day together!


## Key Features 
I implemented a flutter application to represent the idea üì±

I've crafted a Flutter application designed to showcase a selection of flowers, creating an intuitive and engaging user experience.

- Login Page:
   The initial screen prompts users to enter their email and phone number. Access is granted once valid inputs are confirmed, ensuring a secure start.

- Home Page:
  A personalized welcome greets users by name, followed by four distinct sections. Each section represents a different category of flowers, making navigation 
  straightforward and the app more organized.

- Flowers Page:
  Here, all available flowers are displayed. Users can tap the heart icon to 'like' flowers, turning the icon a vibrant red, or press and hold to 'unlike,' reverting the 
  icon to black. A drawer menu enhances user experience by filtering options: cheapest, most expensive, or all. Each filter option leads to a tailored page.

- Flower Item Page:
  Selecting a flower navigates to a detailed page where users can find a description and customer reviews. Adding an item to the cart triggers a confirmation alert, 
  ensuring users are informed before finalizing their choice.

- Favorites Page:
  This page stores all liked items, allowing users to revisit their favorites easily.

- Profile/Account Page:
  Displays all user information, providing a centralized location for personal details and account settings.
